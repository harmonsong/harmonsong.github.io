Welcome! 

I’m Shuhao SONG (宋舒昊), a graduate student specializing in Geophysics at the Southern University of Science and Technology, currently preparing for Ph.D. applications. I have a strong interest and aptitude for applying mathematics, physics, and computer science to solve real-world problems. My current research focuses on advancing multimodal ambient noise surface wave tomography to image high-resolution, complex subsurface structures. I am also interested in exploring advanced techniques for imaging complex subsurface features, such as attenuation analysis, H/V spectral ratios, seismicity, and dv/v monitoring with dataset of dense arrays, Das, and geodetic data. Additionally, I want to integrate Artificial Intelligence to streamline geophysical data processing and minimize redundant manual tasks.

During my academic journey under the guidance of <a href='https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/chenxiaofei.html'>Dr. Xiaofei CHEN</a>, I have focused on enhancing the Frequency-Bessel Transform method (F-J method) for multimodal surface wave tomography, specifically by: (a) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1_meth_nonlinear-stacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrating non-linear cross-correlation stacking methods</a> , and (b) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developing a quantitative subarray selection strategy based on the similarity of dispersion curves</a>. These techniques were applied to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/4_app_tomo-SGB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refine the Vs structure of the Sagebrush Flat Basin at the San Jacinto Fault Zone</a> . Currently, I am working on a new cross-correlation evaluation strategy to enhance overtone surface wave tomography, aiming to boost the energy of the overtones.

Beyond my research, I am passionate about both sports and education. I enjoy playing badminton (proficient) and volleyball (conversant), and have earned a series of championships in both sports. I also have experience tutoring high school students in physics and math, including preparation for the Gaokao in Mandarin and AP courses in English. This teaching experience has honed my communication skills and will be invaluable in future teaching assistant (TA) roles.
