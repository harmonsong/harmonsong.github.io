Welcome! 

I’m Shuhao SONG (宋舒昊), a graduate student specializing in Geophysics at the Southern University of Science and Technology, currently preparing for Ph.D. applications. I have a strong interest and aptitude for applying mathematics, physics, and computer science to solve real-world problems. My current research focuses on advancing multimodal ambient noise surface wave tomography to image high-resolution, complex subsurface structures. I am also interested in exploring advanced techniques for imaging complex subsurface features, such as attenuation analysis, H/V spectral ratios, seismicity, and dv/v monitoring with dataset of dense arrays, Das, and geodetic data. Additionally, I want to integrate Artificial Intelligence to streamline geophysical data processing and minimize redundant manual tasks.

During my academic journey under the guidance of <a href='https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/faculties/chenxiaofei.html'>Prof. Xiaofei CHEN</a>, I have focused on enhancing the Frequency-Bessel Transform method (F-J method) for multimodal surface wave tomography, specifically by: (a) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-1_meth_nonlinear-stacking/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">integrating non-linear cross-correlation stacking methods</a> , and (b) <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developing a quantitative subarray selection strategy based on the similarity of dispersion curves</a>. These techniques were applied to <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/2-2_app_tomo-SGB/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">refine the Vs structure of the Sagebrush Flat Basin at the San Jacinto Fault Zone</a> . Currently, I am working on developing <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-3_meth_cc-correction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new cross-correlation correction strategy to enhance overtone surface wave tomography</a>, aiming to boost the energy of the multimodal surface wave signals.

Beyond my research, I am passionate about both sports and education. I enjoy playing badminton (proficient) and volleyball (conversant), and have earned a series of championships in both sports.
