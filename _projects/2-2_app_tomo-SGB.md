## Abstract
In our previous methodological work, we proposed the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FJ-PST</a> method to address the bifurcation issues commonly encountered when imaging complex subsurface structures. In this study, we applied the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FJ-PST</a> method to image a trifurcated fault system in the San Jacinto Fault Zone, refining its $$v_s$$ structure. The imaging results exhibit high resolution, revealing two buried low-velocity channels, a trapping structure, an inferred fault, and the reverse-wrench mechanism associated with the trifurcation faults. Given the enhanced detail and resolution provided by this method, we believe it is well-suited for delicate subsurface tomography.

## Geological Setting
In this study, ambient noise data recorded by a dense Nodal array around the Clark branch of the SJFZ at the Sagebrush Flats (SGB) was used for tomography. The array had an average 10m row interstation and 30m row separation {% cite sgb %}. {% cite wade2018 %} analyzed the lithology and surface fault traces at the SGB site Based on the $$v_s$$ properties {% cite mordret2019 %} and surface geological mapping results, as depicted in Figure 1(a) (edit from {% cite share2020 %}). Three exposed faults (F102, F104, F106) traverse the array from northwest to southeast, forming the trifurcated fault zone, while another inferred but not field-observed fault (F105) lies to the northeast.

    <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Geological and topographic data are analyzed here. (a) Lithology and damage intensity mapping at the surface modified from Share et al. (2020). The main geological/lithological units are CVP—Coahuila Valley Pluton, BVC—Burnt Valley Complex, Qa—Quaternary sediments, and Qb—Plio-Pleistocene Bautista Formation. More differentiated sediments are Qaf—alluvial fan and Qc—colluvium. The colored dots indicate the damage intensity of the rock. The red solid line represents the strike-slip fault observed from the field by Wade (2018), and the red dashed line represents the inferred faults not observed in the field. (b) Distribution of the dense seismic array used in this study. The background color is the relief calculated within a 10 m radius and topography from the B4 lidar project (Bevis et al., 2005). The blue solid lines are the surface traces for the trifurcation faults, referred to as F106, F104, and F102 from left to right by USGS (Dor et al., 2006). The red solid lines are the same trifurcation faults Wade (2018) obtained after a joint analysis of different research. The red dashed line represents the inferred fault trace. The black solid lines tagged by row numbers indicate the reference locations in Figure 8 and 9.

## Workflow of the FJ-PST
The workflow of integrating <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FJ-PST</a> to obtain a 3D $$v_s$$ model mainly consists of four steps (as shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3):
+ Firstly, subarrays are adaptively generated based on the aimed frequency band from the partition similarity test. 
+ Secondly, the F-J transform is performed to obtain the dispersion spectrogram for each subarray. 
+ Thirdly, multimodal dispersion curves are picked and examined, and the 1D $$v_s$$ structures are obtained by the BFGS method of each subarray. 
+ Finally, all 1D $$v_s$$ structures are merged to construct the 3D $$v_s$$ model using Kriging interpolation.
