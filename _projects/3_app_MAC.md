## Abstract
Dense seismometer arrays offer new opportunities for exploring delicate near-surface near-fault structures. By integrating regional dense seismic array data, seismologists' understanding of fault systems has rapidly improved in the past decade. However, obtaining a high-resolution shear wave velocity structure is still challenging, especially for complex near-fault systems. In this work, we apply the recently developed array-based multimodal surface wave tomography method (the frequency-Bessel transform method, abbreviated as the F-J method) to image complex subsurface systems. This method provides dispersion curves with a broader frequency band, enhanced resolution, and overtone extraction. However, limited by the subarray selection for three-dimensional imaging, integrating the F-J method into complex structures needs a more reliable workflow. We propose the "partition similarity test" method (FJ-PST) to adaptively and quantitatively find suitable subarrays to address the partition challenge adaptively by testing larger subarrays with smaller ones based on the dispersion similarity. 

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
