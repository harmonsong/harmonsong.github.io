## Abstract
In our previous methodological work, we proposed the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FJ-PST</a> method to address the bifurcation issues commonly encountered when imaging complex subsurface structures. In this study, we applied the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FJ-PST</a> method to image the Sagebrush Flat (SGB) site along the Clark fault (CF) strand of the San Jacinto fault zone, refining its $$v_s$$ structure. The imaging results exhibit high resolution, revealing two buried low-velocity channels, a trapping structure, an inferred fault, and notable lateral velocity variations along CF branches. Given the enhanced detail and resolution provided by this method, we believe it is well-suited for complex subsurface tomography.

## Geological Setting
In this study, ambient noise data recorded by a dense Nodal array around the Clark branch of the SJFZ at the Sagebrush Flats (SGB) was used for tomography. The array had an average 10m row interstation and 30m row separation {% cite sgb %}. {% cite wade2018 %} analyzed the lithology and surface fault traces at the SGB site Based on the $$v_s$$ properties {% cite mordret2019 %} and surface geological mapping results, as depicted in Figure 1(a) (edit from {% cite share2020 %}). Three exposed faults (F102, F104, F106) traverse the array from northwest to southeast, forming the branches of Clark fault, while another inferred but not field-observed fault (F105) lies to the northeast.

The background color is the relief calculated within a 10 m radius and topography from the B4 lidar project (Bevis et al., 2005). The blue solid lines are the surface traces for the trifurcation faults, referred to as F106, F104, and F102 from left to right by USGS (Dor et al., 2006).

## Workflow of the FJ-PST
The workflow of integrating <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FJ-PST</a> to obtain a 3D $$v_s$$ model mainly consists of four steps (as shown in Figure 2 for a cartoon and Figure 3 for the application to the SGB array):

First, subarrays are adaptively generated using the PST method. To determine an appropriate target size, the entire array is initially analyzed using the F-J method. The dispersion spectrogram of the entire array (Figure 4(b1)) showed the first bifurcation is around 3 Hz, indicating the minimum resolvable frequency. Based on the maximum phase velocity of approximately 900 m/s observed in Figure 4(b1), the minimum aperture of the subarray estimated by ((4) in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FJ-PST</a>)  is about 150m. Given the near-square shape of the array and its uniform station spacing, square-shaped targets with a side length of 120 m (maximum aperture 170 m) were selected. 

Probes are set to squares of 60 m because bifurcation typically occurs between around 9 Hz and 16 Hz (Figure 4(b2)), requiring a subarray aperture of around 50m by ((4) in <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/projects/1-2_meth_partition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FJ-PST</a>), based on the highest phase velocity of approximately 800 m/s observed among all targets at 9Hz. Setting probes to squares of 60 m ensures accurate extraction of dispersion curves for this frequency range. Subsequently, all possible targets and probes are generated to maximize data utilization and enhance lateral resolution, as shown in Figures 3(a)-(c).

Second, the F-J transform is applied to the cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of each subarray to obtain dispersion spectrograms (Figures 3(e)–(f)). Third, multimodal dispersion curves are picked and examined, and the BFGS method is used to invert these curves to derive the 1D V_s structure for each subarray (Figures 3(h)–(i)). Finally, all 1D $$V_{s}$$ structures are merged using Kriging interpolation to construct the final 3D $$V_{s}$$ model (Figure 3(g))

    <strong>Figure 2.</strong> Illustration of the Partition Similarity Test (PST) concept. <strong>(a) Target and Probe Definition</strong>: In the F-J method, the cross-correlation functions (CCFs) of a seismic station array are used to estimate the velocity structure at its centroid. The "target" refers to a relatively large seismic station array (black hollow circles) spanning multiple one-dimensional velocity structures (orange and green background regions). The target can be divided into smaller subarrays, called "probes" (e.g., three-station groups in this case), which enable localized dispersion curve extraction around the target centroid. Among these, the probe closest to the target centroid is designated as the reference probe (Probe A). The relative error (RE) of all other probes is calculated with respect to Probe A. Probes with the same velocity structure as Probe A are marked in cyan, those spanning two structures are marked in yellow, and those covering a different structure are marked in red. <strong>(b) Relative Error (RE) Calculation</strong>: This panel illustrates the RE calculation and a hypothetical fundamental mode dispersion curve distributions of the probes in (a). Red dots and blue triangles represent dispersion points from an outlier and the reference probe, respectively. The gray "slashed" area denotes the absolute error (AE) between the curves. Dividing the AE by the gray area is defined as the RE. <strong>(c) New Subarray Formation</strong>: Probes with similar dispersion curves (cyan centroids in (a) and corresponding cyan curves in (b)) are combined to form a new subarray. Note that this process excludes certain stations from the target, causing a centroid shift in the new subarray.
